**File Organization:

->This folder contains code, figures and report in respective folders for the Assignment Specification in EC_Student.
->This assignment is based on 2 problems encountered in Hidden Markov Models. 
->The first problem is the Evaluation problem solved using the recursive Forward Algorithm
->The second problem is the Learning problem solved using the Baum Welcher Expectation Maximization Problem.

================================================================

**Source Code:

->The folder contains evaluation.m and learning.m as part of the source code for respective parts of the assignment.

================================================================

**Figures:

->part1.jpg is the diagram for Visualization of Probability Values vs. iterations as part of the learning problem for HMM's.

================================================================

**Report:

->aisraney_extracredit_report is the overall report file

================================================================

**Version:

->The version of matlab used here is r2016 downloaded from drexel software

================================================================
 
**Instructions for tux:

->If Matlab has to be tested on tux, then we can just cd into the directory and type in -> matlab -r "run evaluation.m" to run the code. 
->However, please note that I got a few errors such as dimensions diagree etc while doing these. I am not sure as to be what could be the reason for the same.
