**File Organization:
->This folder contains code(+data), figures, and report in respective folders for the Assignment Specification in HW_3 Student. This assignment is based on Classification using Naive Bayes and Multi-Class SVM (ONE-VS-ALL & ONE-VS-ONE) scheme.

============================================================

**Source Code:

->The folder contains part2.m, partNaiveBayes.dat (DATA), SVM.dat (DATA), part3.m as part of the source code for respective parts of the assignment.
->CTG.csv, spambase.data are the actual data files

->Although the code will work even if the data files (.dat) are not present, it is still included here for convenience.

============================================================

**Figures:
->decisiontree.png is the diagram for the decision tree in theory [part]

============================================================

**Report:
->aisraney_hw3_report is the overall report file

=============================================================

**Version:
->The version of matlab used here is r2016b downloaded from drexel software

==============================================================
 
**Instructions for tux:
->If Matlab has to be tested on tux, then we can just cd into the directory and type in -> matlab -r "run part2.m" to run the code. 
->However, please note that I got a few errors such as dimensions diagree etc while doing these. I am not sure as to be what could be the reason for the same.
