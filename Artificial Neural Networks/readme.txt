
**File Organization:

->This folder contains code(+data), figures, and report in respective folders for the Assignment Specification in HW_4 Student. 
->This assignment is based on Classification (BINARY & MULTI-CLASS) using Artificial Neural Networks using Batch Gradient Descent. 
->An Implementation in part2.m to Visualize Trade off's for Precision vs Recall is also carried out.

============================================================

**Source Code:

->The folder contains part1.m, part2.m, part3.m , ann1.dat (DATA), ann2.dat (DATA) as part of the source code for respective parts of the assignment.

->CTG.csv, spambase.data are the actual data files.

->Although the code will work even if the data files are not present, it is still included here for convenience.

=============================================================

**Figures:

->part1.jpg, part2.jpg, part3.jpg are the diagrams for Visualization tasks of the respective parts of the assignment.

============================================================

**Report:

->aisraney_hw4_report is the overall report file.

=============================================================

**Version:

->The version of matlab used here is r2016b downloaded from drexel software.

==============================================================
 
**Instructions for tux:

->If Matlab has to be tested on tux, then we can just cd into the directory and type in -> matlab -r "run part4.m" to run the code. 
->However, please not that I got a few errors such as dimensions diagree etc while doing these. I am not sure as to be what could be the reason for the same.
