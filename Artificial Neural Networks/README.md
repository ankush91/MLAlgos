
### Organization
* This folder contains code(+data), figures, and report in respective folders for the Assignment Specification in HW_4 Student
* This assignment is based on Classification (BINARY & MULTI-CLASS) using Artificial Neural Networks implementing the Batch Gradient Descent algorithm
* Precision vs Recall graph is also implementated in part2.m

### Source Code
* The folder contains part1.m, part2.m, part3.m , ann1.dat (DATA), ann2.dat (DATA) as part of the source code for respective parts of the assignment
* CTG.csv, spambase.data are the actual data files
* Although the code will work even if the data files are not present, it is still included here for convenience

### Figures
* part1.jpg, part2.jpg, part3.jpg are visualization graphs for the respective parts of the assignment

### Report
* `aisraney_hw4_report.pdf` is the overall solution report

### Matlab Version
* The version of matlab used here is r2016b (Drexel software)
 
### Instructions for Drexel's Tux cluster
