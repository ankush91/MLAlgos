### Source Code
* The folder contains part2.m, part2data.dat (DATA), part3.m, part4.m and part5.m as part of the source code for respective parts of the assignment
* x06Simple.csv is the actual dataset
* part5.jpeg is the visualization for gradient descent in part 5
* Although the code will work even if the data files are not present, it is still included here for convenience
