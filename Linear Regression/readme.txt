**File Organization:

->This folder contains code(+data), figures, and report in respective folders for the Assignment Specification in HW_2 student. This assignment is based on different ways of computing linear regression models. 

============================================================

**Source Code:

->The folder contains part2.m, part2data.dat (DATA), part3.m, part4.m and part5.m as part of the source code for respective parts of the assignment.
->x06Simple.csv is the actual data file.
->part5.jpeg is the visualization for gradient descent in part 5.
->aisraney_hw2_report is the overall report file

->Although the code will work even if the data files are not present, it is still included here for convenience.

=============================================================

**Version:

->The version of matlab used here is r2016b downloaded from drexel software
 
============================================================

**Instructions for drexel's tux:

->If Matlab has to be tested on tux, then we can just cd into the directory and type in -> matlab -r "run part2.m" to run the code. 
->However, please note that I got a few errors such as dimensions diagree, function defn not permitted etc while doing these. I am not sure as to be what could be the reason for the same.
