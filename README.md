# Machine-Learning-Implementations-in-MATLAB

This repository is part of the Implementations for Various Machine Algorithms using Given Assignment Specifications for Course Work in CS 613 (Machine Learning) Graduate Course work at Drexel Univeristy. The Implementations are in Matlab and need Matlab Version r2016b to run

# Basic Theory, PCA, K-means
This folder contains solutions to basic theory questions, relevant implementations for Principal Component Analysis and K-means (EM algorithm) on the 768 data points (8 features) diabetes.csv dataset.

# Linear Regression
This folder contains various implementations of Linear Regression such as the Closed form Solution (Global Least Squared Error), the Closed form Solution (with Cross-Validation), the Closed form Solution (Locally Weighted Linear Regression) and the Batch Gradient Descent Algorithm. The dataset used is 44 tuples (2 features - Age and Temperature of Water) used to predict Length of Fish.
